# Arduino Touch Piano
## Objective
The objective of this project was to create a touch piano using an Arduino and aluminum foil. When the aluminum foil keys are "pressed", the corresponding note is played. Another instrument, the theremin, was also added to the project. This theremin uses variances in light to produce different pitches. 

## Usage
In order to use the touch piano, the correct Arduino and aluminum foil key set-up is required. In addition, the Processing file is required, as it works with Arduino to produce the piano-like sounds and create a display on the computer screen.
